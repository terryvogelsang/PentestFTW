## amplia security - Windows Credentials Editor (WCE)
Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) is a security tool to list logon sessions and add, change, list and delete associated credentials (ex.: LM/NT hashes, plaintext passwords and Kerberos tickets).

This tool can be used, for example, to perform pass-the-hash on Windows, obtain NT/LM hashes from memory (from interactive logons, services, remote desktop connections, etc.), obtain Kerberos tickets and reuse them in other Windows or Unix systems and dump cleartext passwords entered by users at logon.

WCE is a security tool widely used by security professionals to assess the security of Windows networks via Penetration Testing. **It supports Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 7, 2008 and Windows 8.**
