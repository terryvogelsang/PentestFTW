## PentestFTW

This repo includes various tips & tricks related to Penetration Testing. The goal of this repo is to include all tips and tricks discovered while playing with real-life vulnerabilities and CTFs challenges.

For each section, the `README` page includes all useful commands and references to tools and resources related to the section topic. Each vulnerability comes with a `PWNLists` section including one or more links to files containing juicy payloads to test the vulnerability in my PWNLists GitHub Repository.
