# NMAP Recon Cheatsheet

## Test for Heartbleed Vulnerability

`nmap --script ssl-heartbleed --script-args vulns.showall -sV <subnet_goes_here>`

## Firewall present ?

If nmap does not show any filtered port, no firewall is present (Either in front or on the scanned host).

However, firewalls can be configured such that they reply `REJECT` (Acting as a normal TCP/IP response when closed port).
